Once you get into the Heli, you will need to climb to 75m. Anywhere between 15 secs and 90 secs the damage will be applied. The damage will be to the engine OR both the engine and anti-troque system.<br/><br/>Once you have successfully landed, you will need to exit the heli and then get back in to repair any damage (to the heli and yourself).<br/><br/>Remember --- Any landing you can walk away from is a successful landing!!!"]];

Here you can enable Autorotation Practice and also Solo Practice.<br/><br/>Once you have enabled Autorotation Proactice you are free to jump in a heli and start practicing... with a friend. The Menu can only be brought up by those who are not the pilot. This is a deliberate design choice as for any pilot practicing their interations should be exactly the same as in mission.<br/><br/>If you are in any position in the heli that is not the pilot, you can bring up the menu by using you ACE Interact Key.<br/><br/>Once the autorotation menu is disabled it will be removed from your ACE interact, and you will have to return to the <marker name='autoRotMenu'>Autorotation Practice</marker> laptop to enable it again. This will also cancel any Solo Practice previously started."]];
