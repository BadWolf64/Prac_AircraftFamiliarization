The Menu can only be brought up by those who are not the pilot.

The default practice is Open Landing Zonce with no opposition and not teleport to the LZ AO. <br/><br/> OPPOSITION: If you enable opposition, it will spawn 2 groups of EI that will spawn at 2 random locations within the AO.<br/><br/>TELEPORT: If enabled you will be spawned at a random location on a radius of roughly 2km form the LZ. If diabled you will be required to fly to the LZ from your current position.<br/><br/>OPEN and CLOSED LZ: Open LZ's are a little less challenging than the Tight LZs. They are good for practicing formation landings or if you are very new to Helis. Tight LZs are more meant for a single ship and are generally for the more advanced pilot.<br/><br/>GROUP PRACTICE: If you plan on practicing LZ's as a group, only the lead pilot need enable the menu otherwise all other pilots will be assigned different LZ's. Also do not enable Teleport as only the lead pilot will be teleported and everyone else will have to move to the lead pilots position."]];
