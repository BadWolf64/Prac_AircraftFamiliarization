## Interaction

### Settings Menu

The settings menu is available in the map screen. 

Most of the information visible will be task specific. 

There are some overall settings that can be changed without a task selected. These will be available at the top of the settings menu for all other tasks.

#### General Settings 

These settings are avaiable to the player at any time.

* Flight Lead - If set to self, then you are the master of your own destiny. Set to someone else then they will become your flight lead and their settings are your settings.
* Self Interact Menu - This will disable the self interact "Quick Menu" when you are in the Pilot seat of an aircraft so that you can practice as close to session like as possible. 

#### Practice Specific Practice

These settings are only available after selecting the practice that you are undertaking. See the settings section of each of the individual practices below.
### Selecting a task

In order to select a practice you must first select the practice in the "Task" menu in the map screen. 

You are only able to select one practice at a time. 

### Setting up the practice. 

Once a task has been selected you can make changes to the settings in the settings menu described above. 

If you have selected to practice as part of a group, are under instruction, are going through qualification the settings will either not be available to you to change and are determined by the qualification settings or are determined by the flight leader.
## Autorotation and Tail Rotor Loss

Autorotation is the practice of landing a Helicopter with no power.
Tail rotor loss is when you lose use of your tail rotor and lose yaw authority over the aircraft. It is generally best practice to land the aircraft at this point. This practice will focus on putting the aircraft on the deck in one piece.
